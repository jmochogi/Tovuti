<p>I am creating my first post here using Addins section of my RStudio. I just want to see how easy or hard it is to do this in future posts.</p>
<p>After this, I am going to stage the changes, commit them, and finally push them to Github. Netlify should be able to pick the changes up from Git and update the website. I believe I had set continuous deploying so I should be fine.</p>
<p>One thing I am wondering about is whether I will be able to fix this website if it gets broken for some weird reason. I need to learn more about Hugo.</p>
<p>In the meantime, today we went to Yanika’s son’s fourth birthday party. It was big. Lots of (loud) music. Morgan had a lot of fun.
See first picture below:</p>
